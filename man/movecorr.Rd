\description{
The function provides the facility to calculate the least-cost corridor between point locations.
It just requires an input DTM and at least two point locations ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class) representing the locations between which the corridor is calculated.
Under the hood, 'movecorr()' relies on the \code{\link{movecost}} function and, needless to say, implements the same
cost functions. See the help documentation of 'movecost()' for further details.\cr
}
\details{
If only two locations are provided (one via parameter 'a', one via parameter 'b'),
the function renders a raster representing the least cost corridor (which can be optionally exported as GeoTiff) with least-cost paths superimposed.
If more than 2 locations are fed into the function via the 'a' parameter, the function calculates the least-cost corridor between pairs of locations.
All the pair-wise corridor rasters are returned (but not individually plotted) in a list.
All those rasters will be summed, and the resulting raster will be plotted (and can be, optionally, exported as GeoTiff).\cr

The function returns a list containing a number of components (see 'Value' below). For more details about exporting the function's outputs,  see 'Arguments' below. \cr

If the user wants to calculate the least-cost corridor between two locations only, (s)he may want to use parameter 'a' and 'b' to indicate
the two locations of interest respectively. For example, using the datasets provided by this package: \cr

result <- movecorr(a=Etna_start_location, b=Etna_end_location[1,], studyplot=Etna_boundary, funct="tofp") \cr

The above will produce the least-cost corridor between two locations close to Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy), using the
Tobler's cost function (for off-path hiking). Side note: the elevation data will be acquired online. \cr

If the interest lies in using more than 2 locations, the user may want to feed the dataset storing all the locations
into parameter 'a' (disregarding 'b'). As explained above, in this case the function calculates the least-cost corridor between pairs of locations.
All the pair-wise corridor rasters are returned in a list. Those rasters will be summed, and the resulting raster will be plotted (and can be, optionally, exported as GeoTiff).
For example, to calculate the least-cost corridors between every individual unique pair of the 9 locations stored in the 'destin.loc' dataset:\cr

volc <- raster::raster(system.file("external/maungawhau.grd", package="gdistance")) \cr

result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc, funct="ree", rescale=TRUE) \cr

Note that only parameter 'a' has been used. The function returns and plots the sum of the 36 individual corridors; the latter are not plotted,
but are stored in a list. If the user wants to plot the least-cost corridor, say, n 4, and then add the two locations
between which the corridor has been calculated, (s)he can first plot the corridor raster n 4: \cr

raster::plot(result$corridors[[4]]) \cr

Then, identifying which locations are related to corridor n 4 can be easily accomplished by looking up the values stored in
the 4th column of the returned matrix: \cr

result$locations.matrix \cr

The locations are the n 1 and n 5, so the user can add them to the plot previosly produced using: \cr

raster::plot(destin.loc[1,], pch=20, add=T)\cr
raster::plot(destin.loc[5,], pch=20, add=T)\cr

Note that the resulting plot can be produced (with a nicer outlook) directly by 'movecorr()' by feeding those two locations in the
parameter 'a' and 'b' respectively: \cr

result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc[1,], b=destin.loc[5,], funct="ree") \cr

Overall, what 'movecorr()' does is to calculate (via the \code{\link{movecost}} function) the accumulated cost surface around each location.
Those are eventually summed to produce the least-cost corridor between locations. On the produced corridor raster, the cost of a cell is the total cost to reach it
from all the analysed locations. About least-cost corridors between pairs of locations, see for instance: \cr

\examples{
# load a sample Digital Terrain Model
data(volc)


# load the sample destination locations on the above DTM
data(destin.loc)


# calculate the least-cost corridor between two locations, using the
# relative energetic expenditure cost function, and store the results
# in the 'result' object

result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc[1,], b=destin.loc[3,], funct="ree", move=8)


#same as above, but using the 'cognitive slope'

# result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc[1,], b=destin.loc[3,],
# funct="ree", move=8, cogn.slp=TRUE)
