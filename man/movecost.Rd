}
\description{
The function provides the facility to calculate the anisotropic accumulated cost of movement around a starting location and to optionally calculate least-cost path(s) toward
one or multiple destinations. It implements different cost estimations related to human movement across the landscape.
The function takes as input a Digital Terrain Model ('RasterLayer' class) and a point feature ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class), the latter representing
the starting location, i.e. the location from which the accumulated cost is calculated. Besides citing this package,
you may want to refer to the following journal article, where an earlier version of the
package is described: \strong{Alberti (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.softx.2019.100331>}.\cr
Visit this \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLDrkZFh1b_glzCEqKdkPrer72JJ9Ffa/view?usp=sharing}{LINK} to access the package's vignette.\cr
}
\details{
If the parameter \code{destin} is fed with a dataset representing destination location(s) ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class), the function also calculates
least-cost path(s) plotted on the input DTM; the length of each path is saved under the variable 'length' stored in the 'LCPs' dataset ('SpatialLines' class) returned by the function.
In the produced plot, the red dot(s) representing the destination location(s) are labelled with numeric values representing
the cost value at the location(s). \cr

The cost value is also appended to the updated destination locations dataset returned by the function, which
stores a new variable labelled \code{cost}. If the cost is expressed in terms of walking time, the labels accompaining each destinaton location will
express time in sexagesimal numbers (hours, minutes, seconds). In this case, the variable 'cost' appended to the returned destination location datset
will store the time figures in decimal numbers, while another variable named \code{cost_hms} will store the corresponding value in sexagesimal numbers.
When interpreting the time values stored in the \code{cost} variable, the user may want to bear in mind the selected time unit (see right below).\cr

When using cost functions expressing cost in terms of time, the time unit can be selected by the user setting the \code{time} parameter to \code{h} (hours) or to \code{m} (minutes).\cr

In general, the user can also select which type of visualization the function has to produce; this is achieved setting the \code{outp} parameter to either \code{r} (=raster)
or to \code{c} (=contours). The former will produce a raster with a colour scale and contour lines representing the accumulated cost surface; the latter parameter will only
produce contour lines.\cr

The contour lines' interval is set using the \code{breaks} parameter; if no value is passed to the parameter, the interval will be set by default to
1/10 of the range of values of the accumulated cost surface.\cr

It is worth reminding the user(s) that all the input layers (i.e., DTM, start location, and destination locations) must use the same projected coordinate system.\cr


\strong{Cost surface calculation}:\cr
for the cost-surface and LCPs calculation, \code{movecost()} builds on functions from Jacob van Etten's
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=gdistance}{gdistance} package.
Under the hood, \code{movecost()} calculates the slope as rise over run, following the procedure described
by van Etten, "R Package gdistance: Distances and Routes on Geographical Grids" in Journal of Statistical Software 76(13), 2017, pp. 14-15.
The number of directions in which cells are connected in the cost calculation can be set to 4 (rook's case), 8 (queen's case), or
16 (knight and one-cell queen moves) using the \code{move} parameter (see 'Arguments').\cr


\strong{Inhibition of movement (barrier)}:\cr
areas where the movement is inhibited can be fed into the analysis via the \code{barrier} parameter; SpatialLineDataFrame or SpatialPolygonDataFrame can be used.
The barrier is assigned a conductance value of 0 (i.e., movement is inhibited) by default, but the user can assign any other value via the
\code{field} parameter. Internally, the barrier creation rests on the internal \code{create_barrier_cs} function, which relies on the same function
out of an earlier version of the \emph{leastcostpath} package.\cr

To test this facility, consider the following example:\cr

First, we use in-built data to come up with a linear feature (i.e., a LCP) that we will later use as barrier:\cr

result1 <- movecost(volc, destin.loc[1,], destin.loc[4,])\cr

After, we calculate the LCP between two other locations, first not using any barrier (result2), then using the mentioned LCP (from result1)
as a barrier (result3):\cr

result2 <- movecost(volc, destin.loc[3,], destin.loc[6,], move=8)\cr
result3 <- movecost(volc, destin.loc[3,], destin.loc[6,], barrier=result1$LCPs, plot.barrier=TRUE, move=8)\cr

As apparent by comparing result2 to result3, when the barrier is used (result3), the LCP does not cross the barrier but is "forced"
to make a long detour. In result3, the barrier is plotted as a blue line. \strong{Note} that the \code{move} parameter has been set to 8; if set to 16, the LCP will be "able" to jump the barrier.\cr


\strong{DTM featuring irregular margins}:\cr
if the input DTM features irregular margins, e.g a coastline with gulfs and/or inlets where cells corresponding to the sea are given NoData,
the user is to set the \code{irregular.dtm} parameter to TRUE; this will prevent the LCPs to cross the sea. Internally, what \code{movecost()} does is
to generate a polygon vector layer from the DTM and to use the polygon as a mask to create a Transitional Layer via the
internal \code{create_barrier_cs} function, which relies on the same function out of an earlier version from the \emph{leastcostpath} package.
In the mask Transitional Layer those parts corresponding to the terrain are given a conductance value equal to 1, while everything else (i.e., the parts corresponding to the sea)
are given 0 conductance. The mask Transitional Layer is then internally multiplied by the conductance transitional layer representing the cost of movement
(according to the user-selected function). This will set to 0 the conductance values of those parts of the study area that do not correspond to the terrain,
while keeping unaltered the conductance of those parts that do coincide with the terrain.\cr

As a case in point, let's consider the two following examples (using some in-build datasets):\cr

resultA <- movecost(malta_dtm_40, origin=springs[5,], destin=springs[15,], irregular.dtm=FALSE, oneplot=FALSE)\cr

resultB <- movecost(malta_dtm_40, origin=springs[5,], destin=springs[15,], irregular.dtm=TRUE, oneplot=FALSE)\cr

As you can see, in the first case, the LCP between the two locations cross the sea, while in the second case the LCP follows
the coastline. One can also appreciate the difference between the two returned conductance transitional layers:\cr

raster::plot(raster::raster(resultA$conductance))\cr

raster::plot(raster::raster(resultB$conductance))\cr

It is apparent that in the second layer the sea area has been given 0 conductance, while keeping the rest unchanged. If the input DTM does not feature
irregular margins (like, for instance, the built-in \code{volc} DTM), the user may safely leave the \code{irregular.dtm} parameter set to FALSE
(which is the default value).\cr


\strong{Acquiring online elevation data}:\cr
if a DTM is not provided,\code{movecost()}' will download elevation data from online sources.
Elevation data will be acquired for the area enclosed  by the  polygon supplied by the \code{studyplot} parameter (SpatialPolygonDataFrame class).
To tap online elevation data, \code{movecost()}' internally builds on the
\code{\link[elevatr]{get_elev_raster}} function from the \emph{elevatr} package.\cr

The zoom level of the downloaded DTM (i.e., its resolution) is controlled by the parameter \code{z}, which is
set to 9 by default (a trade off between resolution and download time).\cr

To test this facility, the user may want to try the following code, that will generate a least-cost surface and least-cost paths
in an area close the Mount Etna (Sicily, Italy), whose elevation data are acquired online; the start and end locations, and the
polygon defining the study area, are provided in this same package:\cr

result <- movecost(origin=Etna_start_location, destin=Etna_end_location, studyplot=Etna_boundary) \cr

The LCPs back to the origin can be calculated and plotted setting the parameter 'return.base' to TRUE:\cr

result <- movecost(origin=Etna_start_location, destin=Etna_end_location, studyplot=Etna_boundary, return.base=TRUE) \cr

\strong{Terrain slope and cognitive slope}:\cr
when it comes to the terrain slope, the function provides the facility to use the so-called 'cognitive slope',
following Pingel TJ (2013), Modeling Slope as a Contributor to Route Selection in Mountainous Areas, in Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 37(2), 137-148.
According to Pingel, "Humans tend to overestimate geographic slopes by a surprisingly high margin...This analysis indicates downhill slopes are overestimated
at approximately 2.3 times the vertical, while uphill slopes are overestimated at 2 times the vertical.". As a result,
if the parameter \code{cogn.slp} is set to \code{TRUE}, positive slope values are preliminarily multiplied by 1.99, while negative slope values are multiplied by 2.31.


\strong{Terrain factor (N)}:\cr
virtually all the implemented cost functions (with few exceptions) can take into account a 'terrain factor' (\code{N} parameter; 1 by default), which
represents the easiness/difficulty of moving on different terrain types. According to the type of terrain, the energy spent when walking
increases. The same holds true for time, which increases because on a loose terrain (for instance) the walking speed decreases.
While a terrain factor is 'natively' part of the Van Leusen's, Pandolf et al.'s, and Bellavia's cost function,
it has been integrated into the other cost functions as well (when/if relevant).\cr

Note that the terrain factor has NOT been implemented in the Alberti's, Tobler's off-path, and Irmischer-Clarke's off-path cost function.
As for the latter two, they already natively feature a terrain factor. Therefore, it has been implemented only in their on-path version.
Needless to say, if we use a terrain factor of 1.67 with the Tobler's (on-path) hiking function, the results
will be equal to those obtained using the Tobler's off-path function (the reciprocal of 1.67, i.e. 0.60, is in fact
natively used by the Tobler's function for off-path hiking). In fact, compare the results of the following two runs
of  \code{movecost()} (using in-built datasets):\cr

result1 <- movecost(dtm=volc, origin=volc.loc, destin=destin.loc, breaks=0.05, funct="t", N=1.67)\cr
result2 <- movecost(dtm=volc, origin=volc.loc, destin=destin.loc, breaks=0.05, funct="tofp")\cr

The user may want to refer to the following \strong{list of terrain factors}, which is based on the data collected in Herzog, I. (2020).
Spatial Analysis Based on Cost Functions. In Gillings M, Haciguzeller P, Lock G (eds), "Archaeological Spatial Analysis. A Methodological Guide.",
Routledge: New York, 340 (with previous references). The list is divided into two sections (a and b), the first reporting the terrain
factors to be used for cost functions measuring time, the second for functions measuring cost other than time:\cr

(a)\cr
\itemize{
  \item Blacktop roads, improved dirt paths, cement = 1.00
  \item Lawn grass = 1.03
  \item Loose beach sand = 1.19
  \item Disturbed ground (former stone quarry) = 1.24
  \item Horse riding path, flat trails and meadows = 1.25
  \item Tall grassland (with thistle and nettles) = 1.35
  \item Open space above the treeline (i.e., 2000 m asl) = 1.50
  \item Bad trails, stony outcrops and river beds = 1.67

}



\strong{Implemented cost functions}:\cr
note that in what follows \strong{x[adj]} stands for slope as rise/run calculated for adjacent cells:\cr

\strong{Tobler's hiking function (on-path) (speed in kmh)}:\cr

\eqn{ (6 * exp(-3.5 * abs(x[adj] + 0.05))) * (1/N) }\cr


\strong{Tobler's hiking function (off-path) (speed in kmh)}:\cr

\eqn{(6 * exp(-3.5 * abs(x[adj] + 0.05))) * 0.6}\cr

as per Tobler's indication, the off-path walking speed is reduced by 0.6.\cr


\strong{Marquez-Perez et al.'s modified Tobler hiking function (speed in kmh)}:\cr

\eqn{ (4.8 * exp(-5.3 * abs((x[adj] * 0.7) + 0.03))) * (1/N) }\cr

Geografisk Tidsskrift-Danish Journal of Geography, 117:1, 53-62, DOI: 10.1080/00167223.2017.1316212.\cr


\strong{Irmischer-Clarke's modified Tobler hiking function (male, on-path; speed in kmh)}:\cr

\eqn{ ((0.11 + exp(-(abs(x[adj])*100 + 5)^2 / (2 * 30^2))) * 3.6) * (1/N) }\cr

modified version of the Tobler's function as proposed for (male) on-path hiking by Irmischer, I. J., & Clarke, K. C. (2018). Measuring and modeling the speed of human navigation.
Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 45(2), 177-186. https://doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2017.1292150.
It is interesting to note that the hiking speed predicted by this and by the other functions proposed by the authors is slower than the one
modelled by Tobler's hiking function. This is attributed to the cognition involved in wayfinding
, such as map reading, analyzing the terrain, decision making, determining routes, etc.
\strong{Note}: all the all the Irmischer-Clarke's functions originally express speed in m/s; they have been reshaped (multiplied by 3.6) to turn m/s into km/h for consistency
with the other Tobler-related cost functions; slope is in percent.\cr

The cost function originally expresses walking time in seconds; for the purpose of its implementation in this function, it is the reciprocal of time (1/T) that is used in order to eventually get
T/1. Unlike in the original cost function, here the pixel resolution is not taken into account since 'gdistance' takes care of the cells' dimension
when calculating accumulated costs.\cr

\strong{Alberti's Tobler hiking function modified for pastoral foraging excursions (speed in kmh)}:\cr

\eqn{(6 * exp(-3.5 * abs(x[adj] + 0.05))) * 0.25}\cr

proposed by Gianmarco Alberti;
\strong{see}: \href{https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/64172/1/Chapter_9_Locating_potential_pastoral_foraging_routes.pdf}{Locating potential pastoral foraging routes in Malta through the use of a Geographic Information System}.
The Tobler's function has been rescaled to fit animal walking speed during foraging excursions. The distribution of the latter, as empirical data show, turns out to be right-skewed
and to vary along a continuum. It ranges from very low speed values (corresponding to slow grazing activities grazing while walking) to comparatively higher values
(up to about 4.0 km/h) corresponding to travels without grazing (directional travel toward feeding stations).
The function consider 1.5 km/h as the average flock speed, which roughly corresponds to the average speed recorded in some studies, and
can be considered the typical speed of flocks during excursions in which grazing takes place while walking  (typical form of grazing in most situations).
Tobler's hiking function has been rescaled by a factor of 0.25 to represent the walking pace of a flock instead of humans.
The factor corresponds to the ratio between the flock average speed (1.5 km/h) and the maximum human walking speed (about 6.0 km/h) on a favourable slope.\cr

here it is the reciprocal of time (i.e. speed) that is used in order to eventually get the reciprocal of speed (i.e. time).
Slope is dealt with here as originally expressed in Rees' publication (i.e. rise over run). The speed, which is originally expressed in m/s,
has been here transposed to kmh (i.e., multiplied by 3.6) for consistency with other hiking functions.\cr

\strong{Note} that if \eqn{V} is set to 0 by the user, it is internally worked out on the basis of the Tobler function for on-path hiking; therefore, \eqn{V} will not be
considered constant throughout the analysed area, but will vary as function of the slope.

the function's output becomes counterintuitive, as noted in Paez et al. in Journal of Transport Geography 82 (2020) and Herzog I. (2013), Theory and practice

which modifies the Pandolf et al.'s equation; \strong{see} Van Leusen, P. M. (2002). Pattern to process: methodological investigations into the formation and interpretation of spatial patterns in archaeological landscapes. University of Groningen.
\strong{Note} that, as per Herzog, I. (2013). Least-cost Paths - Some Methodological Issues, Internet Archaeology 36 (http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue36/index.html) and
unlike Van Leusen (2002), in the above equation slope is expressed in percent and speed in m/s; also, in the last bit of the equantion, 10 replaces
the value of 6 used by Van Leusen (as per Herzog 2013).\cr
As explained above, if \eqn{V} is set to 0 by the user, it is internally worked out on the basis of the Tobler function for on-path hiking; therefore, \eqn{V} will not be considered constant
throughout the analysed area, but will vary as function of the slope.\cr

\strong{Hare's metabolic energy expenditure cost function (in cal/km)}:\cr

\eqn{ 1 / ((48+30/(1/(6 * exp(-3.5 * abs(x[adj] + 0.05)))))*N) }\cr

\strong{see} Hare T.S., Using Measures of Cost Distance in the Estimation of Polity Bounrdaries in the Post Classic
Yautepec valley, Mexico, in Journal of Archaeological Science 31 (2004). Energetic expenditure is expressed in calories per km; walking speed
is internally worked out from the DTM using the on-path Tobler's hiking function, which is expressed as its reciprocal; walking speed in km/h as per original Tobler's equation
and as requested by Hare's function.\cr



\strong{Note} that the walking-speed-related cost functions listed above are used as they are, while the other functions are reciprocated.
This is done since "gdistance works with conductivity rather than the more usual approach using costs"; therefore
"we need inverse cost functions" (Nakoinz-Knitter (2016). "Modelling Human Behaviour in Landscapes". New York: Springer, p. 183).
 As a consequence, if we want to estimate time, we have to use the walking-speed functions as they are since the final accumulated values will correspond to the
 reciprocal of speed, i.e. pace. In the other cases, we have to use 1/cost-function to eventually get cost-function/1.\cr
