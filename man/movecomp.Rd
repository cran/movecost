\value{
The function returns a list storing the following components
\itemize{
 \item dtm: Digital Terrain Model ('RasterLayer' class); returned only if acquired online
 \item LCPs: estimated least-cost paths ('SpatialLinesDataFrame' class); three variables are stored: 'length', 'cost', and
 'funct'.
 \item LCPs.back: estimated least-cost paths back to the origin ('SpatialLinesDataFrame' class); three variables are stored; see above.
}
}
\description{
The function provides the facility to calculate LCPs using different cost functions and to plot them in the same visual output to allow
comparability. See, for instance, fig. 14.2 in Parcero-Oubina C. et al, Footprints and Cartwheels on a Pixel Road: On the Applicability of GIS for
the Modelling of Ancient (Roman) Routes (2019). In Verhagen P., Joyce J., Groenhuijzen M.R. (eds), Finding the
Limits of the Limes. Modelling Demography, Economy and Transport on the Edge of the Roman Empire, Springer,  291-311.\cr

\details{
Like \code{movecost()}, the function just requires an input DTM ('RasterLayer' class), and an origin and destination dataset  ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class).
The cost functions to be used have to be entered into 'movecomp()' via a character vector fed via the \code{choice} parameter (see the examples below).
If a DTM is not provided, \code{movecomp()} downloads elevation data from online sources for the area enclosed by the polygon fed via
the \code{studyplot} parameter (see \code{\link{movecost}} for more details). Under the hood, \code{movecomp()} relies on \code{movecost()} and implements the same cost functions:
see the help documentation of \code{movecost()} for further information.\cr

\code{movecomp()} produces a plot representing the input DTM overlaid by a slopeshade raster, whose transparency can be adjusted using
the 'transp' parameter. On the rendered plot, the LPCs ('SpatialLinesDataFrame' class) generated by the different input cost functions are given a different line type; a legend
indicates which line type corresponds to which cost function. LCPs back to the origin can be calculated (and plotted) setting the
parameter \code{return.base} to \code{TRUE}.\cr

The function returns the LCPs and (if requested by the user) the LCPs back to the origin. If the DTM has been acquired online, it will be returned as well.
The LCPs (and the LCPs back to the origin) will store three variables: the length of each path, the cost of each path, and an abbreviation corresponding to the cost function used to
generate the LCPs. The mentioned data can be exported by setting the \code{export} parameter to \code{TRUE}.\cr

If the users want to compare the distribution of the length of the LCPs generate by different cost functions,
it suffices to set the \code{add.chart} parameter to \code{TRUE}. Two charts featuring boxplots will be rendered:
one plotting the distribution of the LCPs length by cost function; one portaying the distribution of the cost by cost function.\cr

The following example uses in-built datasets to compare the LCPs generated using two cost functions: the Tobler hiking function , the
wheeled vehicle cost function, and the Pantolf. et al's cost function with correction factor.
LCPs back to the origin location will be calculated as well. The origin and destination locations are close to Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy).
Note that elevation data are acquired online for the area enclosed by the polygon fed via the \code{studyplot} parameter:\cr

result <- movecomp(origin=Etna_start_location, destin=Etna_end_location, choice=c("t", "wcs", "pcf"), studyplot = Etna_boundary, return.base=TRUE)\cr
}
\examples{
# load a sample Digital Terrain Model
data(volc)


# load the sample destination locations on the above DTM
data(destin.loc)


# compare the LCPs generated using different walking-time cost functions (time in minutes)

result <- movecomp(volc, volc.loc, destin.loc, choice=c("t", "ug", "gkrs"), time="m", move=8)

# the distribution of the length and cost of the LCPs by cost function can be easily compared
# using the 'add.chart' parameter:
#result <- movecomp(volc, volc.loc, destin.loc, choice=c("t", "ug", "gkrs"), time="m",
#move=8, add.chart=T)
