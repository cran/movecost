        Least-Cost Paths, and Least-Cost Corridors Related to Human
        Movement Across the Landscape

Description: Provides the facility to calculate non-isotropic accumulated cost surface, least-cost paths, and least-cost corridors using a number of human-movement-related cost functions that can be selected by the user. It just requires a Digital Terrain Model, a start location and (optionally) destination locations. See Alberti (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.softx.2019.100331>.
