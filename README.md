vers 0.6

## History
`version 0.6`:
The facility to download online elevation data (when an input DTM is not provided) has been added; it relies on the 'elevatr' package. Three new datasets (to be used to showcase the added functionality) have been added. Help documentation updated accordingly.

`version 0.5`:
Irmischer-Clarke's modified Tobler hiking functions for female added. This entailed modifying the name of the parameters as follows: `icmonp` for on-path male, `icmoffp` for off-path male, `icfonp` for on-path female, `icfoffp` for off-path female. Minor improvements to the layout of the help documentation.

`version 0.4`:
Parameter `move` added, which provides the option to set the number of directions in which cells are connected in the cost calculation.

`version 0.3`:
added cost functions: Llobera-Sluckin's metabolic energy expenditure; Alberti's Tobler hiking function modified for animal foraging excursions.

`version 0.2`: 
unlike the previous version, the cost calculation is not based on a slope raster (in degrees) derived from the input dtm; instead, the procedure described in van Etten, "R Package gdistance: Distances and Routes on Geographical Grids" in Journal of Statistical Software 76(13), 2017, pp. 14-15 is followed. The altitudinal difference between dtm cells is first calculated and then divided by cell centres distance, so obtaining slope values (expressed as rise over run) changing according to the direction of movement. This has the important implication that the implemented cost functions are now truly anisotropic. The color ramp of the output accumulated cost raster has been changed.

`version 0.1`: 
first release to CRAN.
