# movecost 1.1:

* Fix to an error in the Bellavia's cost function, which has been introduced in ver 1.0.
* The use of a terrain factor (N) has been extended to almost all the implemented cost functions; help documentation updated accordingly.
* Minor adjustements to the returned plots to indicate the value of the used terrain factor.
* Improvements to the content and layout of the 'movecost()'s help documentation.
