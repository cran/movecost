# movecost 2.1:

* Resolved issues with lost braces in `\itemize` sections across multiple Rd files, ensuring that documentation is now correctly formatted and clear. This fix applies to a series of files including `movealloc.Rd`, `movebound.Rd`, `movecomp.Rd`, `movecorr.Rd`, `movecost.Rd`, `movenetw.Rd`, and `moverank.Rd`.

* Corrected the documentation for the internal `create_barrier_cs` function by including the missing `fields` argument in the `\usage` section.

* Minor amendments and improvements content- and layout-wise to the functions' help documentation.
