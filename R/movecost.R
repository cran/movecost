#' R function for calculating accumulated anisotropic slope-dependant cost of movement across the terrain and least-cost paths from a point origin
#'
#' The function provides the facility to calculate the anisotropic accumulated cost of movement around a starting location and to optionally calculate least-cost path(s) toward
#' one or multiple destinations. It implements different cost estimations related to human movement across the landscape.
#' The function takes as input a Digital Terrain Model ('RasterLayer' class) and a point feature ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class), the latter representing
#' the starting location, i.e. the location from which the accumulated cost is calculated. \cr
#'
#' If the parameter 'destin' is fed with a dataset representing destination location(s) ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class), the function also calculates
#' least-cost path(s) plotted on the input DTM; the length of each path is saved under the variable 'length' stored in the 'LCPs' dataset ('SpatialLines' class) returned by the function.
#' In the produced plot, the red dot(s) representing the destination location(s) are labelled with numeric values representing
#' the cost value at the location(s). \cr
#'
#' The cost value is also appended to the updated destination locations dataset returned by the function, which
#' stores a new variable labelled 'cost'. If the cost is expressed in terms of walking time, the labels accompaining each destinaton location will
#' express time in sexagesimal numbers (hours, minutes, seconds). In this case, the variable 'cost' appended to the returned destination location datset
#' will store the time figures in decimal numbers, while another variable named 'cost_hms' will store the corresponding value in sexagesimal numbers.
#' When interpreting the time values stored in the 'cost' variable, the user may want to bear in mind the selected time unit (see right below).\cr
#'
#' When using cost functions expressing cost in terms of time, the time unit can be selected by the user setting the 'time' parameter to 'h' (hours) or to 'm' (minutes).\cr
#'
#' In general, the user can also select which type of visualization the function has to produce; this is achieved setting the 'outp' parameter to either 'r' (=raster)
#' or to 'c' (=contours). The former will produce a raster with a colour scale and contour lines representing the accumulated cost surface; the latter parameter will only
#' produce contour lines.\cr
#'
#' The contour lines' interval is set using the parameter 'breaks'; if no value is passed to the parameter, the interval will be set by default to
#' 1/10 of the range of values of the accumulated cost surface.\cr
#'
#' It is worth reminding the user(s) that all the input layers (i.e., DTM, start location, and destination locations) must use the same projected coordinate system.\cr
#'
#'
#' Cost surface calculation:\cr
#' for the cost-surface and LCPs calculation, 'movecost' builds on functions from Jacob van Etten's
#' \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=gdistance}{gdistance} package.
#' Under the hood, 'movecost' calculates the slope as rise over run, following the procedure described
#' by van Etten, "R Package gdistance: Distances and Routes on Geographical Grids" in Journal of Statistical Software 76(13), 2017, pp. 14-15.
#' The number of directions in which cells are connected in the cost calculation can be set to 4 (rook's case), 8 (queen's case), or
#' 16 (knight and one-cell queen moves) using the 'move' parameter (see 'Arguments').\cr
#'
#'
#' Acquiring online elevation data:\cr
#' if a DTM is not provided, 'movecost()' will download elevation data from online sources.
#' Elevation data will be aquired for the area enclosed  by the  polygon supplied by the 'studyplot' parameter (SpatialPolygonDataFrame class).
#' To tap online elevation data, 'movecost' internally builds on the
#' \code{\link[elevatr]{get_elev_raster}} function from the \emph{elevatr} package.\cr
#'
#' The zoom level of the downloaded DTM (i.e., its resolution) is controlled by the parameter 'z', which is
#' set to 9 by default (a trade off between resolution and download time).\cr
#'
#' To test this facility, the user may want to try the following code, that will generate a least-cost surface and least-cost paths
#' in an area close the Mount Etna (Sicily, Italy), whose elevation data are acquired online; the start and end locations, and the
#' polygon defining the study area, are provided in this same package:\cr
#'
#' result <- movecost(origin=Etna_start_location, destin=Etna_end_location, studyplot=Etna_boundary) \cr
#'
#' The LCPs back to the origin can be calculated and plotted setting the parameter 'return.base' to TRUE:\cr
#'
#' result <- movecost(origin=Etna_start_location, destin=Etna_end_location, studyplot=Etna_boundary, return.base=TRUE) \cr

#'
#'
#' Terrain slope and cognitive slope:\cr
#' when it comes to the terrain slope, the function provides the facility to use the so-called 'cognitive slope',
#' following Pingel TJ (2013), Modeling Slope as a Contributor to Route Selection in Mountainous Areas, in Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 37(2), 137-148.
#' According to Pingel, "Humans tend to overestimate geographic slopes by a surprisingly high margin...This analysis indicates downhill slopes are overestimated
#' at approximately 2.3 times the vertical, while uphill slopes are overestimated at 2 times the vertical.". As a result,
#' if the parameter 'cogn.slp' is set to TRUE, positive slope values are preliminarily multiplied by 1.99, while negative slope values are multiplied by 2.31.
#'
#'
#' Terrain factor (N):\cr
#' virtually all the implemented cost functions (with few exceptions) can take into account a 'terrain factor' (N parameter; 1 by default), which
#' represents the easiness/difficulty of moving on different terrain types. According to the type of terrain, the energy spent when walking
#' increases. The same holds true for time, which increases because on a loose terrain (for instance) the walking speed decreases.
#' While a terrain factor is 'natively' part of the Van Leusen's, Pandolf et al.'s, and Bellavia's cost function,
#' it has been integrated into the other cost functions as well (when/if relevant).\cr
#'
#' Note that the terrain factor has NOT been implemented in the Alberti's, Tobler's off-path, and Irmischer-Clarke's off-path cost function.
#' As for the latter two, they already natively feature a terrain factor. Therefore, it has been implemented only in their on-path version.
#' Needless to say, if we use a terrain factor of 1.67 with the Tobler's (on-path) hiking function, the results
#' will be equal to those obtained using the Tobler's off-path function (the reciprocal of 1.67, i.e. 0.60, is in fact
#' natively used by the Tobler's function for off-path hiking). In fact, compare the results of the following two runs
#' of 'movecost()' (first some data are loaded):\cr
#'
#' volc <- raster::raster(system.file("external/maungawhau.grd", package="gdistance"))\cr
#' data(volc.loc)\cr
#' data(destin.loc)\cr
#'
#' result1 <- movecost(dtm=volc, origin=volc.loc, destin=destin.loc, breaks=0.05, funct="t", N=1.67)\cr
#' result2 <- movecost(dtm=volc, origin=volc.loc, destin=destin.loc, breaks=0.05, funct="tofp")\cr

#' The Tobler's function has been rescaled to fit animal walking speed during foraging excursions. The distribution of the latter, as empirical data show, turns out to be right-skewed
#' and to vary along a continuum. It ranges from very low speed values (corresponding to slow grazing activities grazing while walking) to comparatively higher values
#' (up to about 4.0 km/h) corresponding to travels without grazing (directional travel toward feeding stations).
#' The function consider 1.5 km/h as the average flock speed, which roughly corresponds to the average speed recorded in some studies, and
#' can be considered the typical speed of flocks during excursions in which grazing takes place while walking  (typical form of grazing in most situations).
#' Tobler's hiking function has been rescaled by a factor of 0.25 to represent the walking pace of a flock instead of humans.
#' The factor corresponds to the ratio between the flock average speed (1.5 km/h) and the maximum human walking speed (about 6.0 km/h) on a favourable slope.\cr

#'  As a consequence, if we want to estimate time, we have to use the walking-speed functions as they are since the final accumulated values will correspond to the
