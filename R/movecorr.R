#' R function for calculating least-cost corridor between point locations
#'
#' The function provides the facility to calculate the least-cost corridor between point locations.
#' It just requires an input DTM and at least two point locations ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class) representing the locations between which the corridor is calculated.
#' Under the hood, 'movecorr()' relies on the \code{\link{movecost}} function and, needless to say, implements the same
#' cost functions. See the help documentation of \code{\link{movecost}} for further details.\cr
#'
#' If only two locations are provided (one via parameter 'a', one via parameter 'b'),
#' the function renders a raster representing the least cost corridor (which can be optionally exported as GeoTiff) with least-cost paths superimposed.
#' If more than 2 locations are fed into the function via the 'a' parameter, the function calculates the least-cost corridor between pairs of locations.
#' All the pair-wise corridor rasters are returned (but not individually plotted) in a list.
#' All those rasters will be summed, and the resulting raster will be plotted (and can be, optionally, exported as GeoTiff).\cr
#'
#' The function returns a list containing a number of components (see 'Value' below). For more details about exporting the function's outputs,  see 'Arguments' below. \cr
#'
#' If the user wants to calculate the least-cost corridor between two locations only, (s)he may want to use parameter 'a' and 'b' to indicate
#' the two locations of interest respectively. For example, using the datasets provided by this package: \cr
#'
#' result <- movecorr(a=Etna_start_location, b=Etna_end_location[1,], studyplot=Etna_boundary, funct="tofp") \cr
#'
#' The above will produce the least-cost corridor between two locations close to Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy), using the
#' Tobler's cost function (for off-path hiking). Side note: the elevation data will be acquired online. \cr
#'
#' If the interest lies in using more than 2 locations, the user may want to feed the dataset storing all the locations
#' into parameter 'a' (disregarding 'b'). As explained above, in this case the function calculates the least-cost corridor between pairs of locations.
#' All the pair-wise corridor rasters are returned in a list. Those rasters will be summed, and the resulting raster will be plotted (and can be, optionally, exported as GeoTiff).
#' For example, to calculate the least-cost corridors between every individual unique pair of the 9 locations stored in the 'destin.loc' dataset:\cr
#'
#' volc <- raster::raster(system.file("external/maungawhau.grd", package="gdistance")) \cr
#'
#' result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc, funct="ree", rescale=TRUE) \cr
#'
#' Note that only parameter 'a' has been used. The function returns and plots the sum of the 36 individual corridors; the latter are not plotted,
#' but are stored in a list. If the user wants to plot the least-cost corridor, say, n 4, and then add the two locations
#' between which the corridor has been calculated, (s)he can first plot the corridor raster n 4: \cr
#'
#' raster::plot(result$corridors[[4]]) \cr
#'
#' Then, identifying which locations are related to corridor n 4 can be easily accomplished by looking up the values stored in
#' the 4th column of the returned matrix: \cr
#'
#' result$locations.matrix \cr
#'
#' The locations are the n 1 and n 5, so the user can add them to the plot previosly produced using: \cr
#'
#' raster::plot(destin.loc[1,], pch=20, add=T)\cr
#' raster::plot(destin.loc[5,], pch=20, add=T)\cr
#'
#' Note that the resulting plot can be produced (with a nicer outlook) directly by 'movecorr()' by feeding those two locations in the
#' parameter 'a' and 'b' respectively: \cr
#'
#' result <- movecorr(dtm=volc, a=destin.loc[1,], b=destin.loc[5,], funct="ree") \cr
#'
#' Overall, what 'movecorr()' does is to calculate (via the \code{\link{movecost}} function) the accumulated cost surface around each location.
#' Those are eventually summed to produce the least-cost corridor between locations. On the produced corridor raster, the cost of a cell is the total cost to reach it
#' from all the analysed locations. About least-cost corridors between pairs of locations, see for instance: \cr
